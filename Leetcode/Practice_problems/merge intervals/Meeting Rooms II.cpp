Meeting Rooms II
Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 48.01%Submissions: 21K+Points: 4
Given two arrays start[] and end[] such that start[i] is the starting time of ith meeting and end[i] is the ending time of ith meeting. Return the minimum number of rooms required to attend all meetings.

Note: A person can also attend a meeting if it's starting time is same as the previous meeting's ending time.

Examples:

Input: start[] = [1, 10, 7], end[] = [4, 15, 10]
Output: 1
Explanation: Since all the meetings are held at different times, it is possible to attend all the meetings in a single room.
Input: start[] = [2, 9, 6], end[] = [4, 12, 10]
Output: 2
Explanation: 1st and 2nd meetings at one room but for 3rd meeting one another room required.
Constraints:
1 = start.size() = end.size() = 105
0 = start[i] < end[i] = 106
