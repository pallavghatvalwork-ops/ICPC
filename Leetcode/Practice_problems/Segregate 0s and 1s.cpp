Segregate 0s and 1s
Difficulty: EasyAccuracy: 54.25%Submissions: 136K+Points: 2Average Time: 15m
Given an array arr consisting of only 0's and 1's in random order. Modify the array in-place to segregate 0s onto the left side and 1s onto the right side of the array.

Examples :

Input: arr[] = [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
Explanation:  After segregation, all the 0's are on the left and 1's are on the right. Modified array will be [0, 0, 0, 1, 1].
Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 1, 1]
Output: [1, 1, 1, 1]
Explanation: There are no 0s in the given array, so the modified array is [1, 1, 1, 1]
Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
